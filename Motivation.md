# Thermodynamis in Equlibrium

In a lot of cosmological situations, we reach both kinetic and chemical equilibrium when the reaction rate is greater than the Hubble expansion. Kinetic equilibrium refers to when the exchange between momentum and energy occurs at timescales much shorter than any other bulk properties changing. Chemical equilibrium describes when the transformation of different particle species (ie protons and electrons combining to form Hydorgen) is fast enough before other bulk properties change.


After reaching chemical and thermal equilibrium, the distribution of a particle's momenta is described by the particle mass $m$ and the temperature of the distribution $T$ is given by


$$
\frac{\textrm{d}n}{\textrm{d}\vec{p}} = \frac{g f(E)}{(2 \pi)^3}
$$



$$
\mathrm{CE}(p, y) = \begin{cases}
    -\log(p) & \text{if } y = 1 \\ % & is your "\tab"-like command (it's a tab alignment character)
    -\log(1-p) & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$
